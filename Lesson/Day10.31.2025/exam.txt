1. Khoi tao array 2D, co 5 dong, 5 cot, gia tri phan tu la int, tu 10->30
2. reshape thanh array 1D
3. Extract items in array which is odd numbers
arr[arr%2==1]
4. replace odd numbers in arr with -1
arr[arr%2 == 1] = -1
5. Get common items between numpy arrays? (arr1, arr2)
np.intersect1d(arr1, arr2)
6. Find the max value in 1D array

1. Create a matrix of student scores
import numpy as np

np.random.seed(42)
scores = np.random.randint(50, 100, size=(10, 5))
subjects = ["Math", "Physics", "Chemistry", "English", "History"]
students = [f"Student_{i+1}" for i in range(10)]
1. What is the shape, size, and data type of the scores array?
2. Print all the scores of Student_x (ex: student_3)
3. Print all the scores of subject Physics
4. Display the 3x3 subarray of the top-left corner of the matrix
5. Change the score of Student_1 in Math to 95
Section 2: Statistical Computation
1. Compute the average score of each student.
2. Compute the average score of each subject.
3. Find the highest and lowest scores in the entire dataset.
4. Identify the student with the highest overall average.
5. Identify the subject with the lowest class average.

Section 2: Statistical Computation
1. Compute the average score of each student.
2. Compute the average score of each subject.
3. Find the highest and lowest scores in the entire dataset.
4. Identify the student with the highest overall average.
5. Identify the subject with the lowest class average.
Section 3: Conditional Filtering
1. List all students whose average score ≥ 80.
2. Find all scores that are below 60 and replace them with 60 (to simulate a minimum passing mark).
Section 4: Combining & Sorting
1. Combine students and their average scores into one array using np.column_stack().
2. Sort this combined array by average score (descending).
3. Display the top 3 students.
4. Compute the class median score and compare it with the mean — which is higher?
