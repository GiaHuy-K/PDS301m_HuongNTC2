A small community clinic wants to move from handwritten health notes to a simple computer system that tracks patient information and 
basic health indicators such as blood pressure (BP), weight, and age.
Your job is to build a simple console-based management system in Python.

show_high_bp_patients() — display patients with high BP

remove_patient(patient_id) — delete a record (optional)

save_to_file(filename) / load_from_file(filename) (bonus)

3. Add patient sorting by age or BMI.
4. Save all patients to a CSV or JSON file
5. Search patients by name keyword (not only by ID).
6. Sort patients by age, BMI, or blood pressure using
7. Create a new class Visit to mange Visit History concerning the data of visitors who visited patient.
8. Create a new class to manage Clinic Staff and Role Management, 
regarding role based access (username, password) for Doctor, Receptionist, Admin
