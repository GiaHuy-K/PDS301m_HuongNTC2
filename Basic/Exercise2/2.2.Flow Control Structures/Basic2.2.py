# An important feature of any scripting or programming language is the ability to execute a set of statements as a
# group, but under controlled conditions. From here on out, we'll want to write scripts and save them into a py
# folder maybe in "pr". For each script use Ctrl-n or File New to create a new script. Maximize your IDE screen so
# you can see both the script and the console (where outputs go). Then after composing it, save it to your py
# folder, and run the script with the run button. In some cases, I'll suggest names for your scripts; otherwise make
# one up.
# There are three of these control flow operations:
# operation when to operate
# if Only execute the statements if a particular condition is true
# while Keep executing (loop through) the set multiple times while a condition is true
# for Loop through the set for each value in a range of values
# These follow Python's clear syntax rules:
# A colon is at the end of the initial statement.
# The block of statements to be processed is indented.
# Some important commonalities to these structures:
# The if, while, and for statements all end in a colon, followed by an indented block of statements to be used under
# the conditions defined by the if, while or for. In the code cell, you'll note that after you enter the line with a colon,
# the next line will be indented. In the line following the code you want to run, backspace to get back to an
# unindented section.
