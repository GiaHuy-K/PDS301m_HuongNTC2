# Python has a reasonable set of built-in methods for common programming tasks, but relies substantially on
# modules for methods. Python comes installed with a large number of modules, which you can find described
# online. Some of the more useful modules are math, sys, random, array and os.path.
# There are also many modules you can download -- for example numeric processing, such as numpy -- but to find
# the latest, do searches at www.python.org or google.
# To use a given module, it must be imported first. You do a lot of importing modules in Python. Normally you would
# put a line import at the top of your program. For instance:
# import sys
# would occur at the top of your program before you use any sys methods. It doesn't have to be the first line, just
# before you use it. If you are entering commands through the console, then just do the import before you need to
# use it.
# Multiple modules, separated by commas, can be entered at one time, such as:
# import sys, string, math, os, arcpy
